# Domain-Adaptation-Using-Optimal-Transport-&-Filter-Techniques-as-Wavelet-Transform-in-Speech-Recognition
Domain adaptation using Optimal Transport as Loss Function using Generative Adversarial Networks on regression and classification problems. 
1.- Regression problem: Here we used GAN (Discriminator CNN and Generator a LSTM) & Wavelet Tranform to denoised audio.
2.- Classification problem: Here we used EC-GAN (Discriminador CNN, Generator a LSTM & VGG-Like as classifier)
Both cases are using Optimal Transport as Loss Function.
